##Introducing DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

The DS18B20 temperature sensor is a one-wire digital temperature sensor. This means that it just requires one data line (and GND) to communicate with the Arduino.

It can be powered by an external power supply or it can derive power from the data line (called “parasite mode”), which eliminates the need for an external power supply
